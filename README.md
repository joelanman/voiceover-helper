# Safari VoiceOver Helper Bookmarklet

A bookmarklet is like a normal bookmark, but it runs some Javascript instead of
going to page.

This bookmarklet hides the content of the page, and shows a quick guide to using
VoiceOver.

**This does not replace a professional accessibility audit, or user research with
people who have access needs.**

It is designed to help you learn how to use the
basics of VoiceOver, which can help you design and build your service to better
meet the needs of screen-reader users.

## Get started

1. Open Safari.
2. In the **Bookmarks** menu, click **Show Bookmarks**.
3. Click and drag the link below into your bookmarks.

You can now go to a web page, and click the bookmark to activate VoiceOver Helper.
